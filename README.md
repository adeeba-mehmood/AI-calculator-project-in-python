# AI  Scientific Calculator Project in Python

A simple and **interactive Python calculator** for everyday math and scientific calculations.

## About This Project
This is a **friendly, menu-driven scientific calculator** made in Python. It can help you do **basic math** like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as **scientific calculations** like square root, powers, trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent in degrees), and natural logarithms.

The calculator guides you step by step — you pick what you want to do, enter the numbers or angles, and it shows the result immediately. It’s smart enough to handle things like **division by zero** or invalid inputs without crashing.


## What You Can Do?
* Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
* Find the square root of any number
* Calculate powers/exponents
* Work with angles using sine, cosine, or tangent (degrees)
* Find natural logarithms
* Keep using it until you decide to exit
* Easy menu-driven interface for beginners


## Built With
* Python 3.x
* Python’s built-in `math` library for scientific functions

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script in any Python environment.
2. Pick an operation from the menu that appears.
3. Enter the numbers or angles it asks for.
4. Check the answer instantly.
5. Repeat as needed, or choose “Exit” to close the calculator.
